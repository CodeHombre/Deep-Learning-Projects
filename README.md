1. Worked on a problem of classifying images as cat or non-cat using logistic regression. 
2. Worked with the MNIST Dataset of identifying handwritten digits using deep neural network (both using pytorch and from scratch)
3. Applied the k-nearest neighbours and condensed k-nearest neighbours algorithms from scratch
